#### Description:

The **Task Manager** is a browser-based to-do list application that allows users to create, manage, filter, and complete tasks efficiently. It’s built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with `localStorage` for persistent state saving across browser sessions.

This app enables users to:
- Add tasks with **priority levels** (Low, Medium, High)
- Set optional **start** and **due dates**
- **Search** through tasks in real time
- **Filter** tasks by status: All, Active, Completed
- **Toggle between light and dark modes**
- **Track progress** with a visual progress bar
- Edit or delete individual tasks

##### Features:
- **Responsive UI** with modern styling and CSS variables
- **Dark Mode toggle** (stored in localStorage)
- **Persistent tasks and theme** using localStorage API
- Dynamic **task filtering** and live **search functionality**
- Task **editing via double-click** and confirmation prompt
- Custom priority badges with color indicators
- Clean UI layout and mobile-friendly design

##### Files:
- `index.html`: Main structure of the app
- `style.css`: Handles all styling, including theme switching and responsive layout
- `script.js`: All interactive logic including form handling, task rendering, filtering, and persistence

##### Design Decisions:
- **Vanilla JavaScript** was used to align with CS50x’s Week 8 focus and show mastery without reliance on libraries/frameworks.
- **LocalStorage** was chosen to avoid backend complexity and keep the app fast and standalone.
- **Progress bar** was added to help users visualize completion status.
- Dark mode was added for improved UX and to demonstrate CSS variable usage.

This project was created as a final project for **CS50x 2025**. It demonstrates applied knowledge from several course topics including web development, DOM manipulation, data storage, and software design thinking.
